# Countdown Timer

This simple web page and JavaScript script create a countdown timer that displays the time remaining until a specified end date and time. Users can see the countdown in terms of days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

## Getting Started

To use this countdown timer, follow these steps:

1. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser.

2. The timer will display the time remaining until the specified end date and time.

## Code Structure

- The HTML file (`index.html`) defines the structure of the web page. It includes the countdown timer elements and links to external CSS and JavaScript files.

- The CSS file (`style.css`) is referenced in the HTML file and provides some basic styling for the countdown timer and its overlay.

- The JavaScript file (`script.js`) handles the countdown logic. It calculates the time remaining, updates the input fields in the HTML, and runs the countdown timer. The end date is set in the JavaScript file, and the countdown is updated every second.

## Customization

You can customize the countdown by changing the end date and time in the JavaScript file:

```javascript
const endDate = "24 Feb 2025 10:00 PM";
```

You can also modify the styling by editing the CSS file (`style.css`) to match your design preferences.

## Countdown Logic

The JavaScript code calculates the time remaining by finding the difference between the end date and the current date in seconds. It then converts this difference into days, hours, minutes, and seconds and updates the corresponding input fields in the HTML.

## JavaScript (script.js)

The JavaScript code handles the countdown timer functionality. Here's how it works:

It sets the endDate variable to "24 Feb 2025 10:00 PM."

It selects all the <input> elements on the page and stores them in the input array.

The clock function calculates the time remaining by finding the difference between the endDate and the current date. It then updates the input fields to display the days, hours, minutes, and seconds remaining.

If the countdown has reached its end (i.e., diff is less than 0), the timer will not update further.

The code uses the setInterval function to continuously call the clock function every second (1000 milliseconds) to keep the countdown timer updated.
